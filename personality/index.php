            <p>I love personality categorizations because they make my organizational brain happy, 
                and give me better ways to understand myself. I think in terms of socionics the most, 
                after a strong hyperfixation in 2015. Despite that, I love finding new ways to slap new labels 
                onto myself and add them to the larger illustration of who I am.</p>
            <p>This is a result of that introspective reflection, mixed with things I attribute to myself just for fun. 
                Doubles/triples/etc. welcome and all that. &hearts;

Detailed description: Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen.">
